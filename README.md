# GTA V Autopatcher v2.0


DESCRIPTION:

This program will automatically back up your existing files, and downgrade any GTA V install to version 1.27, whether it's the Rockstar version, or the Steam version. Once it's done so, you can restore the previously backed-up version of the game by running the program again.


INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Download ZIP package from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=13BanLSa7552Gj_qt22ShnogXcewPblk-) or the [Releases](https://github.com/DaWolf85/GTAVAutoPatcher/releases) page

2. Make sure the game runs and all first-time setup programs have been completed, before executing this script.

3. Make sure you have exited the game, and that the Rockstar Launcher/Social Club are not running.

4. Run AutoPatcher.exe and follow the on-screen directions.

5. Complete all the uninstallers the script opens (it will probably crash if you just close them).

6. Make sure the progress bar has reached the end, and the output window says "All done!"


TROUBLESHOOTING:

- If you get the error "GTA5.exe not found" when running the game, try setting GTAVLauncher.exe to run as administrator. This will require that LiveSplit and OBS run as administrator, if you use them.

- If the autopatcher cannot access its own files, please ensure you are running it from the folder it came in. You do not need to move it, or any of the files it came packaged with.

- If the autopatcher cannot access the game location to make changes, make sure you've exited the game, and that the Launcher/Social Club are not running.

- If you get the message "Error response from Steam", open Steam, go to the game properties, click on the "Local Files" tab, and select the option "Verify Integrity of Game Files". Once the game has finished reinstalling, run it as many times as you need to until it completes all setups and boots up to the main menu. Then close it, close the Launcher, and run the autopatcher again.


NOTES:

- If you need to ask any questions, report any bugs, or make any suggestions, please contact DaWolf85#0589 on Discord. Please make sure you have read all messages the script outputs before doing so. I may not be amused if your problem is one you could have solved on your own.

- While this program is meant for those who are less technically inclined, or who have issues with patching their game, it is still only release candidate software and may have bugs. I cannot completely test all edge cases, as the script is relatively complex and I have limited time. Please report any bugs you may encounter.

- I do not have access to the Rockstar version of the game (whether installed through Social Club, or the Launcher). As such, this is relatively untested on that version. Please let me know if you encounter any issues. I should be able to send you a testing version of the script to help us debug the issue. Please do not contact me in private if you are unwilling to help me test the issue, instead please ping me in public so others can step in to help test.
